Created dataset for Telecom customer churn
Churn, in the context of business and customer relationships, refers to the phenomenon where customers stop doing business with a company or cancel their subscriptions/services over a given period. It's a critical metric for companies, especially those with a subscription-based or recurring revenue model, because it directly impacts revenue and growth.
